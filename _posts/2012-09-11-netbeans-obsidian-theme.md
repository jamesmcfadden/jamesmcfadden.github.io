Having recently switched from Eclipse to Netbeans for various reasons, I have found myself missing the "Obsidian" theme (originally from [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/), I believe).

Unable to find a sufficient port from Eclipse to Netbeans on the Internet, I decided to begin setting it up myself:

[![Netbeans Obsidian Theme](http://jamesmcfadden.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/obsidian-php.png "Netbeans Obsidian Theme")](http://jamesmcfadden.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/obsidian-php.png)

While I am still working on the HTML/ CSS themes, I think the PHP is pretty much ready to go, so I've made the theme available to download [here](http://jamesmcfadden.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/netbeans-obsidian-theme.zip). I will update this post as and when I get time to add to the theme, but I feel it's certainly usable at the moment (PHP, HTML, CSS).

Also note that I've made a few changes here and there to suit my own needs, so I make no guarantee that this theme directly mimics the original Obsidian theme, but you get the gist.

### Installation

After downloading the theme, open Netbeans and navigate to Tools > Options. Click Import in the bottom left of the window and navigate to the theme's Zip folder. Select "Fonts &amp; Colours" in the Available options and click OK.

Netbeans will restart and your theme should automatically be activated upon load.
